## Ordinals Primary Name Protocol
The Bitcoin ecosystem currently lacks a primary name protocol, so the related blockchain explorers, third-party NFT markets, and DApp websites for Bitcoin have not been able to display users' wallet addresses as a more readable name, unlike Ethereum. If there were a primary name protocol in the Bitcoin ecosystem, it could allow some wallet addresses to be disseminated in a more user-friendly form within the Bitcoin community and further spread to non-Bitcoin communities, enhancing the influence of the Bitcoin community.

There are already multiple Ordinals name protocols, with typical examples being .btc Name and .sats Name. It is hoped that there can be a rule that accommodates the mainstream Ordinals name protocols, reducing the development and integration costs for all parties involved.
